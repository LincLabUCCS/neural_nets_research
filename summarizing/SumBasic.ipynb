Searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve , for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness . The first thing I noticed was the time .  9:35AM That was no dream , it could n't have been ... Stop the plane , I want to get off ?  I 've been a cop for a long time , that 's the good news .  The bad ?  I 'm stuck in a metal tube that I think is going to explode in less than an hour and I have to find out how without panicking anyone .  Especially if I 'm wrong .  But what if I 'm right ?  No resources , no back-up , no escape .  Fuck it , no problem .  *****  9:36AM  Alright . We 're too far away to do anything about that , the map shows somewhere over the Pacific . Not like anyone would believe me .  I 'm not entirely sure I believe me .  My only hope is that I can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens . I mean , I guess it could be but that 's a slim shot in the dark .  So what in the blue hell blows up a plane over the ocean ? Experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to ... relieve yourself . She saw it too . I guess I have a partner . I might not be wrong .  ****  9:37AM  I wave to her and motion towards the washrooms .  `` You saw it ? ''  She nodded .  `` Did you see anything ? ''  She shook her head . Then something clicked .  `` Do you remember which way the explosion came from ? ''  She tilted her head as if she was remembering . What the hell is going on ? '' Six rows of nine , that 's ... 54 if any math from school stuck . She said , grabbing my arm . So that means- '' She finished , which would usually annoy me but in this case it was nice to have someone pick up on it nice and quick .  I checked my watch .  9:41AM .  We were running out of time .  ****  9:42AM Stuff like that .  As I watched I saw there were three people acting nervously .  One portly man checking his watch a little too frequently .  A younger man sweating profusely .  A woman glancing around with what I would describe as suspicion . Or maybe we had three nervous flyers .  9:45AM .  Seconds were ticking by and we had a very limited number of those to start .  As we stood there a flight attendant approached us from behind . That 's when I slammed into her full force , throwing both our bodies to the hard floor and skidding at least three rows ahead .  When I lifted my head I was staring down the barrel of a handgun .  A young man , sweating profusely , was holding the right end of it and I was definitely on the wrong end . Which meant things were going from bad to worse .\n",

      "” Literally . My daughter was just struck- “ Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . ”  My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . ” Something with my house… I jumped up the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . ”\n",

      "My insides turn as I feel the swing connect . * I 'm not the bad guy . * We are currently three stories high . * I shift to make sure . *  Yeah ... it broke . Whitney is nervously peering out of it , scanning the grounds . she shouts before disappearing back into the house . * I 'm not the bad guy .  From the other side of the house , I hear the front door open , followed by the shuffle of feet against gravel . I need you to keep it together '' Whitney 's voice is stern but supportive .  Though she does n't speak , Cindy 's breathing begins to steady . In the next few seconds , they will drive off , and I can go back to being alone . * They keep trying , but it 's no use . He tries to make me chase them , but I refuse . * He takes control of me , one limb at a time , and everything fades . I try not to think about her again as I continue walking . The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside . I find something else , too : a photograph . He fills me with the same kind of dread I feel every time I hear -- She flies backward onto an old table , which breaks underneath her . *  I do n't want to . *  No . *  NO ! She picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward . I feel my body begin to go limp again , though nothing steps in to take control . Whitney shouts at me , but I do n't blame her . It 's only important that I know it , that I feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade .  I 'm not the bad guy .\n",
